# Vapor Passkey Demo

Proof of concept app for trying to integrate passkeys and WebAuthn into Vapor

## Usage

Clone the project, then in Terminal run

```bash
swift run
```

In your browser go to http://localhost:8080 and follow the steps!

> **Note**: This is proof of concept code to scope out the work to build a Swift Server library for WebAuthn. I do not advise using it in production until it's had some 
eyes on it. Many things are unimplemented and untested so be warned! Only tested on macOS 12.4 with Safari 15.5
